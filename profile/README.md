This is the DELTA GLOW 2024 project organisation.

Everyone is free to make their own repository to test around with ideas. But if you want your code to be used you will have to make a branch and pull request to one of the following repositories:
-  Tube: Handles the code for the microcontroller in the tube
-  Networking: Handles the code for the teensy and macmini sound controll
-  Design: Keeps track of all design files
